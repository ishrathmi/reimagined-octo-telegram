Hello, welcome to my empty repo!
=======
good evening, I am making this change to test changes made on the main branch. 


this is change no 3 made on github.com


git clone folderURL
code README.md
git add -A
git commit -m 'add your commit message here'
git push

git checkout -b 'branch name'

a. What is an issue?
Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more. As issues are created, theyâ€™ll appear here in a searchable and filterable list. 

b. What is a pull request?


c. How do I open up a pull request?

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

f. What does git diff do?

g. What is the main branch?
